//! This module defines structures and traits to build and manipulate traces.
//! A trace is a collection of data points that represent the execution of a
//! program.
//! Some trace can be seen as "decomposable" in the sense that they can be
//! divided into sub-traces that share the same columns, and sub-traces can be
//! selected using "selectors".
