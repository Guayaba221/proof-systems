# RFC: Keccak

The Keccak gadget is comprised of 3 circuit gates (Xor16, Rot64, and Zero)

Keccak works with 64-bit words. The state is represented using $5\times 5$ matrix
of 64 bit words. Each compression step of Keccak consists of 24 rounds. Let us
denote the state matrix with A (indexing elements as A[x,y]), from which we derive
further states as follows in each round. Each round then consists of the following 5 steps:

$$
\begin{align}
C[x] &= A[x,0] \oplus A[x,1] \oplus A[x,2] \oplus A[x,3] \oplus A[x,4] \\
D[x] &= C[x-1] \oplus ROT(C[x+1],1) \\
E[x,y] &= A[x,y]  \oplus D[x] \\
B[y,2x+3y] &= ROT(E[x,y],\rho[x,y]) \\
F[x,y] &= B[x,y] \oplus ((NOT B[x+1,y]) AND B[x+2,y]) \\
Fp[0,0] &= F[0,0] \oplus RC
\end{align}
$$

FOR $0\leq x, y \leq 4$ and $\rho[x,y]$ is the rotation offset defined for Keccak.
The values are in the table below extracted from the Keccak reference
<https://keccak.team/files/Keccak-reference-3.0.pdf>

|       | x = 3 | x = 4 | x = 0 | x = 1 | x = 2 |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| y = 2 | 155   | 231   | 3     | 10    | 171   |
| y = 1 | 55    | 276   | 36    | 300   | 6     |
| y = 0 | 28    | 91    | 0     | 1     | 190   |
| y = 4 | 120   | 78    | 210   | 66    | 253   |
| y = 3 | 21    | 136   | 105   | 45    | 15    |

## Design Approach:

The atomic operations are XOR, ROT, NOT, AND. In the sections below, we will describe
the gates for these operations. Below are some common approaches followed in their design.

To fit within 15 wires, we first decompose each word into its lower and upper 32-bit
components. A gate for an atomic operation works with those 32-bit components at a time.

Before we describe the specific gate design approaches, below are some constraints in the
Kimchi framework that dictated those approaches.
* only 4 lookups per row
* only first 7 columns are available to the permutation polynomial
